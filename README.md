A company mangament websiste using HTML, CSS, JAVA, using a mySQL database and SQL functions. It isn't completely finished but you can manage employee details such as personal details, 
dependants, department and location they work at. I've included the simple CRUD functions of create, read, update, delete which you can do to most tables to better manage data. Any data
changed on the websiste is updated on the database too. Still can be made into a much bigger websiset, it got me a mid first for my university coursework.
